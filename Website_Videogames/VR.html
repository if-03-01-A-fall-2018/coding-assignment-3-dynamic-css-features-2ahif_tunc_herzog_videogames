			<h3>How It Works</h3>
			<p>
				Virtual reality (VR) is an interactive computer-generated experience taking
				place within a simulated environment. It incorporates mainly auditory and visual
				feedback, but may also allow other types of sensory feedback like haptic. This
				immersive environment can be similar to the real world or it can be fantastical.
				Augmented reality systems may also be considered a form of VR that layers virtual
				information over a live camera feed into a headset or through a smartphone or tablet
				device giving the user the ability to view three-dimensional images.

			<h3>The Origins</h3>

			<p>
				In the 1950s Morton Heilig wrote an "Experience Theatre" that could encompass all
				the senses in an effective manner, thus drawing the viewer into the onscreen activity.
				He built a prototype of his vision dubbed the Sensorama in 1962, along with five short
				films to be displayed in it while engaging multiple senses (sight, sound, smell, and touch).
				Predating digital computing, the Sensorama was a mechanical device. Heilig also developed what he
				referred to as the "Telesphere Mask" (patented in 1960). The patent application described the device
				as "a telescopic television apparatus for individual use...The spectator is given a complete
				sensation of reality, i.e. moving three dimensional images which may be in colour, with 100%
				peripheral vision, binaural sound, scents and air breezes".

			<h3>Where We Are Today</h3>

			<p>
				Current VR technology most commonly uses virtual reality headsets or multi-projected
				environments, sometimes in combination with physical environments or props, to
				generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical
				presence in a virtual or imaginary environment.</p>
			<p>A person using virtual reality
				equipment is able to "look around" the artificial world, move around in it, and
				interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets
				consisting of a head-mounted display with a small screen in front of the eyes, but
				can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens. VR
				systems that include transmission of vibrations and other sensations to the user through
				a game controller or other devices are known as haptic systems. This tactile information
				is generally known as force feedback in medical, video gaming, and military training applications.
