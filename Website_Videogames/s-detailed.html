      <h2 style="text-align: center"> The Steam Launcher </h2>
      <hr>
      <p style="text-align: center"> Steam is a launcher run by Valve which is a game studio run by
        Gabe Newell, but is focused on making money to sell games from
        other studios. So far, they have rarely developed games. The latest project
        was Artifact. Steam does not only launch the games; it also provides
        a shop, a market, a community page, friendslist, and mod support. </p>

        <h2> The Store</h2>

          <p style="text-align: center"> The Steam Store is basically nothing else but a online store where
            you can buy games. Sometimes there will be a discound on your games like in normal stores and
            they also have a summer and a winter sale which is the cheapest way to get games nowadays. With
            discounds going up to -90% and with some actions where you even get games for free! With that the
            team store sets new standarts as a gaming launcher. You can search for games by genres or by price
            or if you want to risk something you can try a free to play game.

<h2> The Library<h2>

<article>

<p style="text-align: center"> what you see in the picture above is the Steam library.
This library shows you which games you own, how long you played them, if friends are playing now,
if friends have this game too, your latest achievements, workshop links, the newest updates and
so on. You can sort your games by your own tags like you see on the left. It also has the feature to
add games which are normally not in the steam store. Or which you baught physically.
</p>



<h2> The Market Place</h2>

  <p style="text-align: center"> The ingame loot in games might not be the biggest deal for some people
    but one mans trash is anothe mans treasure. So Steam made it possible to not only trade item for item,
    they even made it possible to trade ingame loot for real money. But this feature is only provided by
    steam the real worth is made by the players and the rarity of the items. If someone wants a item for a
    cheap price he can make offers someone can take if he owns the item. And people who want to sell the
    item cann set a price at which they will be willing to sell their goods. The problem is not on the
    market place, its on the trading option. You can trade items with friends and strangers but sometimes
    people will try to scam others for their precious loot. It already happend very often. But this kind
    of scam is not possible on the market place because you can't haggle with the owner who wants to sell.

<h2> The Community</h2>

<p style="text-align: center"> The Workshop is where you can try out community made objects, skins, missons,
  etc. Everyone can post their creation in the workshop. It's very easy. You can not only post your ingame
  creation on steam, you can also make some guides which will help new players, or you can show off your funny or amazing
  screenshots you made while playing the games. Even artwork is appreciated.

  little community.
