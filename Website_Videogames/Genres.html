			<h2 > The Genres </h2>

			<p style="text-align: center"> Some of the most common are: </p>

			<h3>RPG (RolePlayGame)</h3>
			<p>A role-playing game is a game in which players assume the roles
				of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility
				for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal
				acting or through a process of structured decision-making of character
				development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according
				to a formal system of rules and guidelines.</p>

			<h3>Action/Adventure</h3>
			<p>An action-adventure game can be defined as a game with a mix of
				elements from an action game and an adventure game. Action-adventures
				require many of the same physical skills as action games, but also
				offer a storyline, numerous characters, an inventory system, dialogue,
				and other features of adventure games. They are faster-paced than pure
				adventure games, because they include both physical and conceptual challenges.
				Action-adventure games normally include a combination of complex
				story elements, which are displayed for players using audio and video.
				The story is heavily reliant upon the player character's movement,
				which triggers story events and thus affects the flow of the game. </p>

			<h3>FPS (First Person Shooter)</h3>
			<p> An FPS is a genre
				of action video game that is played from the point of view of the protagonist.
				FPS games typically map the gamer's movements and provide a view of what an actual
				person would see and do in the game. Usually the protagonist's arms are seen at the
				bottom of the screen, carrying whatever weapon is equipped. The gamer is expected to
				propel his avatar through the game by moving it forward, backward, sideways and so
				on using the game controller. In order to increase the level of realism, many games
				include the sounds of breathing and footsteps in addition to the regular sound effects. </p>

			<h3>Open World</h3>
			<p> The term "open world" doesn't have a clear definition. But the most common usage of
				"open world" refers to a game that features free-roaming outdoor exploration across a large
				game world that is fully-scaled and continuous. The term "open world" is rarely used in
				reference to games where exploration is limited to indoor dungeons, or games with outdoor
				overworld maps that are not to scale. </p>

			<h3>MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena)</h3>
			<p>The MOBA genre is one of the most popular genres on the PC. In this Gamemode a team of 5 Players
			try to demolish the enemy 5 Player teams base while protecting their own base. On the map are 3 lanes
			which connect the bases and a jungle with many NPC monsters inbetween these lanes. On the lanes are
			several turrets from both teams, mostly there are 2. In the base is the final which can be a christal
		  or a big boss which destruction will be the win for the opposit team. In each team are 5 different
		 	Heros from 5 different roles. These roles are mostly Tank, Fighter, Mage, Assassin, Marksman and the
			Support. No 2 characters are the same and they need a good team combination and good teamwork for the win </p>

			<h3> MMOG (Massively Multiplayer Online Game)</h3>
			<p>A MMOG (also called MMO) is a multiplayer video game which is capable of
			supporting large numbers of players simultaneously. By necessity, they are played on the Internet. Many games have at
			least one persistent world, however others just have large numbers of players competing at once in one form or another
			without any lasting effect to the world at all. These games can be found for most network-capable platforms, including
			the personal computer, video game console, or smartphones and other mobile devices.
			MMO games can enable players to cooperate and compete with each other on a large scale, and sometimes to interact meaningfully
			with people around the world. They include a variety of gameplay types, representing many video game genres, an example is the
			widely played game Minecraft which can be played both as an MMO or a single player </p>

			<h3>Horror</h3>
			<p>Like with movies there are some games which are only ment to scare the person playing them. The game industry potentially has
			more options to frighten the Player because the player has to be the protagonist and not the one watching the protagonist.
		  The games use atmospherics, gore, deaths, blood and monsters to frighten players. Other then movies, videogames have more
		  free space on publishing adult content so most of the horror games are going beyond lines which most of the times attracts
		 	the media who are complaining about videogames beeing too violent.</p>

			<h3>Strategy</h3>
			<p>Strategy games are spread among the more skilled players which already played 1000 hours to know every move anybody can make
				or which are the best at the start of the game. They know the base stats of troops, every counter attack they can make, how
				they can make the biggest army in short time and etc. The most popular are the middle aged themed games but there are a lot more
				then that. There are several themed possibilities from fantasy themed games where you can be the leader of elves or orcs to futuristic
				themed gameswhere you can fight against Aliens and controll space mariens. But they do not only have to be about fighting each other
				they can also be about leading a company or trying to survive in an post apocalyptic world or just a simple round of chess with just
				some animations.

			<h3>Fantasy</h3>
			<p>Due to RPG origins with Dungeons & Dragons and other pen and paper role-playing games, the most popular setting for RPG by far is a fantasy world,
				usually with heavy medieval high fantasy influences, with series such as Diablo, Final Fantasy, Elder Scrolls and Baldur's Gate sharing a basic fantasy
				setting. However, numerous exceptions exist, with some notable examples including the East Asian settings of Far East of Eden and Jade Empire, the steampunk
				 settings of Final Fantasy VI and Grandia, the science fiction settings of Star Ocean, Xeno, Knights of the Old Republic, and Mass Effect, the retro-futuristic
				 setting of Fallout, and the contemporary settings of Mother, Megami Tensei and Alpha Protocol. </p>

			<h3>Sandbox</h3>
			<p>Sandbox or Open World allow the player a large amount of freedom and usually contain a somewhat more open free-roaming meaning the player is not confined to a
				single path restricted by rocks or fences etc. Sandbox games such as the Grand Theft Auto series, with a large number of interactable non-player characters, large
				amount of content and typically some of the largest worlds to explore and longest playtimes of all RPG due to an impressive amount of secondary content not critical
				to the game's main storyline. Sandboxes often attempt to emulate an entire region of their setting. Popular examples of this genre are the
				Zelda, Wasteland, Deus Ex, The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Gothic and Xenoblade Chronicles series</p>
