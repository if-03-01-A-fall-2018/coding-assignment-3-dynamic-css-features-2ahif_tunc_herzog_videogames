      Gabe Newell, but is focused on making money to sell games from
      other studios. So far, they have rarely developed games. The latest project
      was Artifact. Steam does not only launch the games; it also provides
      a shop, a market, a community page, friendslist, and mod support.

      game companies. The service is provided across various platforms like PC,
      PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and even Wii U. Uplay is exclusively used by
      first-party Ubisoft games, and although some third-party titles are sold
      through the Uplay store, they do not use the Uplay platform. Responses to
      the platform have been generally negative, with coverage comparing it
      negatively to its competitors and calling it the worst part of Ubisoft's games.
