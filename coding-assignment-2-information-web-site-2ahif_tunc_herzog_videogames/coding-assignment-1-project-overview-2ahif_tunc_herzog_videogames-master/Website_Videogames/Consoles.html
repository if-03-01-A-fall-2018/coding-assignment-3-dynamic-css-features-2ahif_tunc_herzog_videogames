					<p>Nintendo is a Japanese multinational consumer electronics and video game
			company headquartered in Kyoto. It's one of the world's largest video game
			companies by market capitalization, creating some of the best-known and
			top-selling video game franchises, such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda,
			and Pokémon. Founded on 23 September 1889 by Fusajiro Yamauchi, it
			originally produced handmade hanafuda playing cards. By 1963, the company
			had tried several small niche businesses, such as cab services and love
			hotels. Abandoning previous ventures in favour of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo
			developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of
			the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company
			with a market value of over $85 billion.</p>
