				company headquartered in Kyoto. It's one of the world's largest video game
				companies by market capitalization, creating some of the best-known and
				top-selling video game franchises, such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda,
				and Pokemon. Founded on 23 September 1889 by Fusajiro Yamauchi, it
				originally produced handmade hanafuda playing cards. By 1963, the company
				had tried several small niche businesses, such as cab services and love
				hotels. Abandoning previous ventures in favour of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo
				developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of
				the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company
				with a market value of over $85 billion.</p>
