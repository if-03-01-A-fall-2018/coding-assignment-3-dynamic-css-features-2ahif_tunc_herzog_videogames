      <p>Steam is a launcher run by Valve which is a game studio run by
        Gabe Newell, but is focused on making money to sell games from
        other studios. So far, they have rarely developed games. The latest project
        was Artifact. Steam does not only launch the games; it also provides
        a shop, a market, a community page, friendslist, and mod support.

      <img src="uplay.png" alt="uplayLogo" class="uplay">
      <p>Uplay is a digital distribution, digital rights management, multiplayer and
        communications service developed by Massive Entertainment to provide an
        experience similar to the achievements/trophies offered by various other
        game companies. The service is provided across various platforms like PC,
        PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and even Wii U. Uplay is exclusively used by
        first-party Ubisoft games, and although some third-party titles are sold
        through the Uplay store, they do not use the Uplay platform. Responses to
        the platform have been generally negative, with coverage comparing it
        negatively to its competitors and calling it the worst part of Ubisoft's games.
