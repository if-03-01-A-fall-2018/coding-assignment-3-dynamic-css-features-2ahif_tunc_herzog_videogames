      <h2> What Are Video Games? </h2>
      <p> A computer (or video) game is a computer-controlled game where players interact with objects displayed on a
        screen for the sake of
        entertainment.
        The term "computer game" also includes games which display only text or which use other methods, such as sound
        or vibration, as their
        primary feedback device, or a controller (console games), or a combination of any of the above.</p>

      <h2>A Bit Of History</h2>
      <p> The history of video games goes as far back as the early 1950s, when academic computer scientists began
        designing simple
        games and simulations as part of their research or just for fun. At M.I.T. in the 1960s, professors and
        students played games
        such as 3D tic-tac-toe and Moon Landing. These games were played on computer such as the IBM 1560, and moves
        were made by means
        of punch cards.</p>
      <p>Video gaming did not reach mainstream popularity until the 1970s and 1980s, when video arcade games and gaming
        consoles using joysticks, buttons, and other controllers, along with graphics on computer screens and home
        computer games were
        introduced to the general public. Since the 1980s, video gaming has become a popular form of entertainment and
        a part of modern
        popular culture in most parts of the world. One of the early games was Spacewar!, which was developed by
        computer scientists.
        Early arcade video games developed from 1972 to 1978.</p>
      <p>During the 1970s, the first generation of home consoles emerged, including
        the popular game Pong and various "clones". The 1970s was also the era of mainframe computer games. The golden
        age of
        arcade video games was from 1978 to 1982. Video arcades with large, graphics-decorated coin-operated machines
        were common
        at malls and popular, affordable home consoles such as the Atari 2600 and Intellivision enabled people to play
        games on
        their home TVs.</p>
      <p>During the 1980s, gaming computers, early online gaming and handheld LCD games emerged; this era was
        affected by the video game crash of 1983. From 1976 to 1992, the second generation of video consoles emerged.</p>
